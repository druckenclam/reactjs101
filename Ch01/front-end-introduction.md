## Preface
With the growing complexity of the mordern web and the increased focus on user experience, web design and development has evolved accordingly: no person can do it alone; web developers have specialized in areas such as Web Front End, Web Back End, etc. In light of the demand for cross-platform applications against the backdrop of fast-growing technology innovations, frontend developers are in high demand in the market, and also face growing challenges.

## Scope of Frontend Engineering
In fact，frontend engineers undertake a range of roles and responsibilities in the industry. Some focus more on Web Design, while others are more concerned about software engineering, the perspective of this book.Requisite skills include HTML、CSS, JavaScript, etc. In the past，frontend engineering had been targeting exclusively applications for broswers, but now it is no longer the case. Rather, it aims to develop cross-browser, cross-platform applications. Below are some examples.

1. Web Browser Applications.
2. CLI based Headless Applications. For Example: [phantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/).
3. WebView Applications. For Example: [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/),[NW.js](http://nwjs.io/), and Desktop Applications.
4. Native Applications Using Web Technology。For Example: [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)、[Native Script](https://www.nativescript.org/)

過去幾年，前端開發就像經歷了文藝復興（Rinascimento）的年代，開始了各種框架、套件百花齊放的時代。雖然現在有更多好用工具可以協助開發，但前端工程師似乎並沒有變得比較輕鬆。以往若能妥善運用 jQuery 等函式庫就可以應付大部分前端工程師的工作，但現在前端徵才廣告上不僅要求精通 HTML、CSS 和 JavaScript，還要對於還要對於 [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)、[Ember](http://emberjs.com/)、[Angular](https://angularjs.org/)、[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)、[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) 等 JavaScript 框架或函式庫有一定程度的了解。

Of all the JavaScript frameworks and libriaries，[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is an opensource [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) library developed and promoted by Facebook. It brought about quite a few revolotionary ideas about the web development such as Virtual DOM, Web Component, intuitive and declarative UI designing, graceful support for server rendering, etc. Next up, we will introduce readers of this book to React with a brief overview to React Ecosystem, preparing our readers for building cross-platform React applications from scratch.
