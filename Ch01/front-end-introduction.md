## Preface
With the growing complexity of the mordern web and the increased focus on user experience, web design and development has evolved accordingly: no person can do it alone; web developers have specialized in areas such as Web Front End, Web Back End, etc. In light of the demand for cross-platform applications against the backdrop of fast-growing technology innovations, frontend developers are in high demand in the market, and also face growing challenges.

## Scope of Frontend Engineering
In fact，frontend engineers undertake a range of roles and responsibilities in the industry. Some focus more on Web Design, while others are more concerned about software engineering, the perspective of this book.Requisite skills include HTML、CSS, JavaScript, etc. In the past，frontend engineering had been targeting exclusively applications for broswers, but now it is no longer the case. Rather, it aims to develop cross-browser, cross-platform applications. Below are some examples.

1. Web Browser Applications.
2. CLI based Headless Applications. For Example: [phantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/).
3. WebView Applications. For Example: [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/),[NW.js](http://nwjs.io/), and Desktop Applications.
4. Native Applications Using Web Technology。For Example: [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Native Script](https://www.nativescript.org/)

Last couple of years witnessed a renaissance in web frontend development, with a large number of frameworks sprouting up. Despite all the tools at the disposal, the job has not been made easier for frontend developers. jQuery used to good enough to solve most of the problems for frontend developers. Nowadays, not only are job-seekers required to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript，but they are also expected to know Javascript frameworks and/or libraries, such as [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)、[Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

Of all the JavaScript frameworks and libriaries，[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), an opensource [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) library developed and promoted by Facebook, brought about quite a few revolotionary ideas about the web development such as Virtual DOM, Web Component, intuitive and declarative UI designing, graceful support for server rendering, etc. Next up, we will introduce readers of this book to React with a brief overview to React Ecosystem, preparing our readers for building cross-platform React applications from scratch.
